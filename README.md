### 05 Create Image Captioning Models

1. What is the name of the dataset the video uses to train the encoder-decoder model?

   COCO dataset
2. What is the goal of the image captioning task? 

   To generate text captions for images
3. What is the purpose of the attention mechanism in an encoder-decoder model?
   To allow the decoder to focus on specific parts of the image when generating text captions.
   
4. What is the purpose of the encoder in an encoder-decoder model?
  
  To extract information from the image.
  
5. What is the name of the model that is used to generate text captions for images?
  
  Encoder-decoder model
  
6. What is the purpose of the decoder in an encoder-decoder model?
  
  To generate output data from the information extracted by the encoder
